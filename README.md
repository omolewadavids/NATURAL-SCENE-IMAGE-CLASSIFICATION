# NATURAL-SCENE-IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION

## Objective:
My objective is to build a powerful Neural Network that can classify natural scene images into 6 categories. {'buildings' -> 0, 'forest' -> 1, 'glacier' -> 2, 'mountain' -> 3, 'sea' -> 4, 'street' -> 5 } with more accuracy using CNN with transfered learning. The Model will be trained on AWS SageMaker.

### Data Source
This data was initially published on [DataHack](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com) by Intel to host a Image classification Challenge.
